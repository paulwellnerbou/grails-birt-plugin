# grails-birt-plugin

Plugin for Grails 4+ offering BIRT functionality from legacy Grails 2 BIRT Plugin (http://grails.org/plugin/birt-report)

--- 

This plugin takes mainly [eyck's](https://github.com/eyck) code from his [BIRT Plugin for Grails 2](https://github.com/eyck/grails-birt-report),
restructured so that it works with Grails 3 and works with reports from classpath resources, not only from files.

As I am neither an expert for grails nor for BIRT, there may be way better methods to set up this Grails 3 plugin or
to initialize the BIRT engine. If so, please contact me, open an issue or create a pull request.

# Usage

## Setup

1. Include the dependency in your `build.gradle` of your Grails 4 project:
```
repositories {
    maven {
        url  "https://dl.bintray.com/paulwellnerbou/maven" 
    }
}

...

dependencies {
    compile 'org.grails.plugins:birt-report:4.4.0'
}
```

For Grails 3, use version `4.3.0.4`.
	
2. Add `BirtReportService` to your beans in your `resources.groovy`:
```
birtReportService(BirtReportService, grailsApplication)
```
3. Use `BirtReportService` in your Controllers/Services, it will be automatically injected:
```
class MyController {

    BirtReportService birtReportService
    ...
}
```

## Configuration

The location of the reports can be configured in your `application.groovy` with

```
birt {
    reportHome = "classpath:Reports"
    useGrailsDatasource = false
    generateAbsoluteBaseURL = false
    baseUrl = ...
    imageUrl = ...
}
```

This are the default values. Your reports are found in the application's classpath if they are packaged correctly as
resources (this is `src/main/resources` by convention).

I don't really know what the other configuration options are exactly doing, the source code was copied without modifying the
logic from [Eyck's original sources](https://github.com/eyck/grails-birt-report/blob/master/grails-app/services/com/itjw/grails/birt/BirtReportService.groovy).
Please consider reading [the source](src/main/groovy/com/itjw/grails/birt/BirtReportService.groovy) to find out more. If you found out, please tell me, so I can update the documentation.

If you want to use reports from filesystem, you can use the `file:` prefix:

```
birt {
    reportHome = "file:path/to/your/reports"
}
```

## Creating a report

Have a look at the unit test class `BirtReportServiceTest`, where a sample report is created.

### Create a PDF file

```groovy
def parameters = [:]
def birtReportTmpFile = "anyTmpFileName"
def reportName = "myReport" // .rptdesign is added automatically
def options = birtReportService.getRenderOption(null, 'pdf')
birtReportService.run(reportName, parameters, birtReportTmpFile)
def targetFileName = "/path/to/target/file.pdf"
def result = birtReportService.render(targetFileName, parameters, options)
new File(targetFileName).newOutputStream() << result.toByteArray()
```

### Use it in your servlet context to deliver a PDF as response

```groovy
def parameters = [:]
def birtReportTmpFile = "anyTmpFileName"
def reportName = "myReport" // .rptdesign is added automatically
def options = birtReportService.getRenderOption(request, 'pdf')
birtReportService.run(reportName, parameters, birtReportTmpFile)
def result = birtReportService.render(targetFileName, parameters, options)
response.setHeader("Content-disposition", "attachment; filename=report.pdf")
response.contentType = 'application/pdf'
response.outputStream << result.toByteArray()
```

# Test, build & install

	./gradlew check install

The `check` task will build and run the tests. The `install` tasks will package the plugin and publish it to your
local Maven repository.

# Release

```
./gradlew release -Prelease.useAutomaticVersion=true -PpublishUser=<user> -PpublishKey=<key>
```
